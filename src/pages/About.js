            <p>Hello! I am Melissa Valencia, a senior at Dartmouth College majoring in Computer Science 
            and double minoring in Human-Centered Design and Spanish. I am from Los Angeles, California. 
            In my free time, I love going to the beach and biking around the city. I also 
            enjoy going to concerts, music festivals, and sports games! Along with that,
            I am a huge foodie, so I love trying out new places to eat.</p>
